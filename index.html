                    <p>

                        This volume presents the first major study of C.G. Jung’s curious relationship
                        with the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza.
                        Although Jung scarcely mentions Spinoza in his work, there is an unmistakable
                        accord between the core ideas of both thinkers, most notably
                        regarding Spinoza’s theory of God and the monism found in Jung’s writings.
                        Exploring why Jung shows ambivalence toward Spinoza despite their
                        affinity, Robert H. Langan argues that Spinoza offers Jung a radical solution
                        to problems in his psychology. What results is a new interpretation of
                        Jung’s metaphysics, the evidence for which has gone unheeded in Jungian
                        studies to date. Ultimately for both Jung and Spinoza, knowledge of the self
                        leads to knowledge of the Divine, and it is this championing of a ‘transcendental
                        immanence’ that makes Jung an unlikely yet consummate Spinozist.
                         Jung and Spinoza will be of interest to continental philosophers and depth
                        psychologists who wish to bridge their respective fields, as well as general
                        audiences curious about the ideas of both thinkers.
